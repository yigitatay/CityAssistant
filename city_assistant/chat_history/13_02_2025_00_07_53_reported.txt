City Asisstant: Hello, I am here to help with anything regarding residential issues. Ask me a question!
User: I realized that a recycling cart is broken where I live. How quickly can it be repaired?
City Assistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure which specific request type to use for a broken recycling cart in your residence. However, you can try reaching out to the Department of Public Works (DPW) in Washington D.C. for assistance with repairing your recycling cart. They typically estimate a resolution time of 20 business days for recycling cart repairs.
