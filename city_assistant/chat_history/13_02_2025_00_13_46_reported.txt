City Asisstant: Hello, I am here to help with anything regarding residential issues. Ask me a question!
User: There is a broken recycling cart next to my house. How quickly can it be repaired?
City Assistant: I'm sorry, I'm not sure which specific request type to use for a broken recycling cart next to your house. I recommend contacting the Department of Public Works (DPW) directly to report the issue and inquire about the repair timeline. They will be able to assist you promptly and provide the necessary support for the repair of the recycling cart.
